        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a programming language for creating instruction for a computer to follow. Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is used for:\n",
        "\n",
        "    web development (server-side),\n",
        "    software development,\n",
        "    mathematics,\n",
        "    system scripting.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This language is widely used in the data industry. It hae a lot of libraries such as pandas, seaborn, numpy.\n",
        "  - It is used for frontend, backend and also in data analysis.\n",
        "  - Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.\n",
        "  - Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).\n",
        "  - Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
        "  - It can be used in numerous applications, including:\n",
        "    Web development\n",
        "    Data science and analysis (Pandas, NumPy)\n",
        "    Machine learning and artificial intelligence\n",
        "    Automation and scripting\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - A Python interpreter is a program that directly executes Python code line by line. It reads your code, translates it into bytecode, and runs it using the Python Virtual Machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - In Python, pre-defined keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes within the language. You cannot use them as identifiers (like variable names, function names, or class names). They are fundamental to Python's syntax and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Below are some keywords serve various purposes, such as:\n",
        "    Defining control flow (e.g., if, else, for, while).\n",
        "    Creating functions and classes (e.g., def, class).\n",
        "    Handling exceptions (e.g., try, except).\n",
        "    Performing logical operations (e.g., and, or, not).\n",
        "    Importing modules (e.g. import, from)\n",
        "    Defining boolean values (True, False)\n",
        "    Defining null values (None)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Python's keywords are reserved words that have specific, pre-defined meanings within the language. Attempting to use a keyword as a variable name will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Eg.\n",
        "        for = 10\n",
        "        class = \"MyClass\"\n",
        "\n",
        "        This will cause a syntax error as \"for\" and \"class\" are reserved key words.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python means whether a value of any object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    Mutable object-> Objects can be modified after they created as List, dictionary, sets.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Immutable object-> Objects can't be modified after they created as integers, float, tuples, string.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - The difference between the mutability of lists and the immutability of tuples in Python stems from their design and intended use cases.\n",
        "  \n",
        "    Lists (Mutable)->\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Lists are designed for collections of items that may need to be modified. This includes adding, removing, or changing elements. This is accomplished through operations like append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), List[0]=\"New_val\".\n",
        "    \n",
        "    It is used for storing dynamic collection of data, building data structure that requires modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Tuples (Immutable)->\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Tuples are designe for collection of item that should not be changed. They are intended for situation where data integrity is crucial and accidentally modification should be prevented. We can not add, remove or change elements in tuples.\n",
        "    It is used for storing the data that should not be change e.g. coordinates, Unique identification nos., account no etc.\n",
